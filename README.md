# Predicting pollution in Seoul

This project was made for an assignment for an MSc module titled Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Development. Tackling pollution is a vital task for sustainability researchers and essential for maintaining a healthy environment to live in. As such, I was curious whether air pollution could be predicted, which could aid in devising a strategy to tackle it and identifying the main culprits. To do this, I chose to work with pollution data in Seoul; as pollution is a significant issue in South Korea, they have rich and detailed data available. I found that a linear regression model can fairly accurately predict short-term air pollution without needing extensive historical data.

# Setup

To run the notebook, download all the files and unzip the data folders into the same directory as the notebook (I was unable to upload the .csv files directly as they were over GitHub's limit).
